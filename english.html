            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm Shoki Koya.</p>
            <p>I'm currently studying design and film independently while working on practical university projects creating product packaging and brochures.</p>
            <p>I use Adobe's After Effects, Photoshop, and Illustrator to continually refine my skills, aiming to meet client requirements flawlessly in future professional engagements.</p>
            <p>My strengths lie in genuinely enjoying design work and approaching various projects and products with curiosity and a drive for improvement.</p>
            <p>Looking ahead, I aspire to excel as a creator who understands client needs through meticulous communication, delivering designs that surpass expectations.</p>
            <p>My portfolio showcases past works and projects.</p>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>CD Package Design</h3>
                <p>This project was created as part of a junior college class assignment. A classmate acted as the client, simulating a client-creator relationship. Under the rule of not using free materials, I embodied the client's requirements by acting as the girl in the silhouette and implementing various creative techniques.</p>
                <p>The brief included abstract expressions such as "POP feel" and "wild", which I interpreted and expressed in an idol-like manner. As mentioned, I posed as the girl and created silhouettes. For realistic images of beer and meat, I substituted with household items and blurred them to obscure details. The challenge of capturing a summer beach in spring was addressed by using paintings and taking photos at dusk, then adjusting them in Photoshop to minimize seasonal differences.</p>

                <h3>Fruit Mix Juice Package</h3>
                <p>I conceptualized a new product, targeting specific market demographics. The project involved preparing materials, structuring the ingredient list, and creating a 3DCG model for brochure design.</p>
