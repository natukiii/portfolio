            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm Shoki Koya.</p>
            <p>I study design and film independently while working on practical university projects creating product packaging and brochures.</p>
            <p>Currently, I use Adobe After Effects, Photoshop, and Illustrator to continually improve my skills to perfectly meet client demands in future professional work.</p>
            <p>My strengths lie in my genuine enjoyment of design work and my curiosity and drive to improve by exploring various projects and products.</p>
            <p>In the future, I aim to become a creator who, through meticulous communication, understands client needs and delivers designs that exceed expectations.</p>
            <p>This portfolio showcases my past works and projects.</p>

            <h2>Package Design</h2>
            <div class="project">
                <h3>CD Package Design</h3>
                <p>This project was created as part of a junior college class. A classmate acted as the client, simulating a client-creator relationship. Under the rule of not using free materials, I embodied the client's requirements by acting as the girl in the silhouette and implementing various creative techniques.</p>
                <p>The brief included abstract expressions such as "POP feel" and "wild", which I interpreted and expressed in an idol-like manner. As mentioned, I posed as the girl and created silhouettes. For realistic images of beer and meat, I substituted with household items and blurred them to obscure details. The challenge of capturing a summer beach in spring was addressed by using paintings and taking photos at dusk, then adjusting them in Photoshop to minimize seasonal differences.</p>

                <h3>Fruit Mix Juice Package</h3>
                <p>I conceptualized a new product, targeting specific market demographics. The project involved preparing materials, structuring the ingredient list, and creating a 3DCG model for brochure design.</p>
                <p>When creating this project, I collected materials on the conventional design of mixed juice. While many designs effectively convey the freshness and variety of fruits concisely, I felt that reducing the amount of information could decongest the colors on the package and emphasize the key points. Therefore, I devised a simple and clear design to effectively communicate the product's appeal and differentiate it from other products.</p>
                <p>In conceptualizing a simple design, I referred to banners and signs in the city to create a design proposal for mixed juice. Here are some of the observations I made while collecting materials. First, many banners and signs are designed with only large text to convey information even to people moving in cars, with illustrations limited to single points and the main focus being the text. Furthermore, I discovered that very few banners or signs are achromatic, with the text and background being colored and the number of colors used being limited. Understanding the challenge of "conveying information simply," I created the final design.</p>
